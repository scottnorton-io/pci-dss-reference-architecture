**CONDUEIT: WEAK AND LEAK - A STORY OF TRANSFORMATION**

In the beginning, a startup company named **Condueit: Weak and Leak** set out on a journey to become a one-stop-shop for its clientele.

The creative chaos was the lifeblood of the organization, inspiring a wide array of projects and ideas, with employees from diverse backgrounds and nationalities working tirelessly around the clock. 

However, amidst this rapid innovation, one essential aspect was left in the shadows - security. Data security was seen as someone else's concern, not a priority for a business fueled by the fire of creation and the rush to ship out the next product.

Next came the journey towards [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) compliance using the [PRIORITIZED APPROACH](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/?document=Prioritized_Approach_PCI_DSS_4_0). As the organization hit each milestone, it symbolized a significant stride towards their goal.
