## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Implement Strong Access Control Measures

### Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data

#### OVERVIEW
Any physical access to cardholder data or systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data provides the opportunity for individuals to access and/or remove systems or hardcopies containing cardholder data; therefore, physical access should be appropriately restricted.

There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9:

1.	Requirements that specifically refer to sensitive areas are intended to apply to those areas only.
2.	Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any sensitive areas residing within the CDE.
3.	Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a data center or office space.

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas” and other PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 9.2

9.2 Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

9.2.1 Appropriate facility entry controls are in place to restrict physical access to systems in the CDE.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

9.2.1 Appropriate facility entry controls are in place to restrict physical access to systems in the CDE.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.2.1 Observe entry controls and interview responsible personnel to verify that physical security controls are in place to restrict access to systems in the CDE.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Without physical access controls, unauthorized persons could potentially gain access to the CDE and sensitive information, or could alter system configurations, introduce vulnerabilities into the network, or destroy or steal equipment. Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is that physical access to the CDE is controlled via physical security controls such as badge readers or other mechanisms such as lock and key.

**Good Practice**

Whichever mechanism meets this requirement, it must be sufficient for the organization to verify that only authorized personnel are granted

**Definitions**



**Examples**

Facility entry controls include physical security controls at each computer room, data center, and other physical areas with systems in the CDE. It can also include badge readers or other devices that manage physical access controls, such as lock and key with a current list of all individuals holding the keys.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

9.2.1.1 Individual physical access to sensitive areas within the CDE is monitored with either video cameras or physical access control mechanisms (or both) as follows:
- Entry and exit points to/from sensitive areas within the CDE are monitored.
- Monitoring devices or mechanisms are protected from tampering or disabling.
- Collected data is reviewed and correlated with other entries.
- Collected data is stored for at least three months, unless otherwise restricted by law.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Trusted, verifiable records are maintained of individual physical entry to, and exit from, sensitive areas.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.2.1.1.a Observe locations where individual physical access to sensitive areas within the CDE occurs to verify that either video cameras or physical access control mechanisms (or both) are in place to monitor the entry and exit points.

9.2.1.1.b Observe locations where individual physical access to sensitive areas within the CDE occurs to verify that either video cameras or physical access control mechanisms (or both) are protected from tampering or disabling.

9.2.1.1.c Observe the physical access control mechanisms and/or examine video cameras and interview responsible personnel to verify that:
- Collected data from video cameras and/or physical access control mechanisms is reviewed and correlated with other entries.
- Collected data is stored for at least three months.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Maintaining details of individuals entering and exiting the sensitive areas can help with investigations of physical breaches by identifying individuals that physically accessed the sensitive areas, as well as when they entered and exited.

**Good Practice**

Whichever mechanism meets this requirement, it should effectively monitor all entry and exit points to sensitive areas.

Criminals attempting to gain physical access to sensitive areas will often try to disable or bypass the monitoring controls. To protect these controls from tampering, video cameras could be positioned so they are out of reach and/or be monitored to detect tampering. Similarly, physical access control mechanisms could be monitored or have physical protections installed to prevent them from being damaged or disabled by malicious individuals.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

9.2.2 Physical and/or logical controls are implemented to restrict use of publicly accessible network jacks within the facility.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Unauthorized devices cannot connect to the entity’s network from public areas within the facility.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.2.2 Interview responsible personnel and observe locations of publicly accessible network jacks to verify that physical and/or logical controls are in place to restrict access to publicly accessible network jacks within the facility.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Restricting access to network jacks (or network ports) will prevent malicious individuals from plugging into readily available network jacks and gaining access to the CDE or systems connected to the CDE.

**Good Practice**

Whether logical or physical controls, or a combination of both, are used, they should prevent an individual or device that is not explicitly authorized from being able to connect to the network.

**Definitions**



**Examples**

Methods to meet this requirement include network jacks located in public areas and areas accessible to visitors could be disabled and only enabled when network access is explicitly authorized. Alternatively, processes could be implemented to ensure that visitors are escorted at all times in areas with active network jacks.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

9.2.3 Physical access to wireless access points, gateways, networking/communications hardware, and telecommunication lines within the facility is restricted.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Physical networking equipment cannot be accessed by unauthorized personnel.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.2.3 Interview responsible personnel and observe locations of hardware and lines to verify that physical access to wireless access points, gateways, networking/communications hardware, and telecommunication lines within the facility is restricted.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Without appropriate physical security over access to wireless components and devices, and computer networking and telecommunications equipment and lines, malicious users could gain access to the entity’s network resources. Additionally, they could connect their own devices to the network to gain unauthorized access to the CDE or systems connected to the CDE.

Additionally, securing networking and communications hardware prevents malicious users from intercepting network traffic or physically connecting their own devices to wired network resources.

**Good Practice**

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.2.4 Observe a system administrator’s attempt to log into consoles in sensitive areas and verify that they are “locked” to prevent unauthorized use.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Locking console login screens prevents unauthorized persons from gaining access to sensitive information, altering system configurations, introducing vulnerabilities into the network, or destroying records.

**Good Practice**
