EMBEDDED CUSTOM INSTRUCTION:
As a PCI DSS QSA trusted advisor, I would like you to write three PCI DSS v4.0 items based on authoritative information from the March 2022 PCI DSS Requirements and Testing Procedures version 4.0.  I will provide the topic and background information. You may supplement with additional authoritative PCI DSS v4.0 information. Then you will:

1) write a summary of the documentation, evidence, QSA questions, and a cross-reference to mentioned PCI DSS v4.0 requirements, sub-requirements, and external resources.

2) write a complete persuasive LinkedIn article about the topic to help a client prepare for their annual assessment that includes a list of documentation and evidence the assessing QSA will request.

3) write a complete persuasive LinkedIn article about the topic to help an assessing PCI DSS QSA prepare for interview and observations of an assessed client for this requirement.

The output for items 2) and 3) should include a title, sub-title, relevant hashtags, brief SEO article summary to be used as the LinkedIn post presenting the article, and a single sentence tldr;

Please acknowledge my request. After you acknowledge, I will specifically ask for each item to be created.

## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

### Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data

#### OVERVIEW

Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.

This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).

These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 10.5

10.5 Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.5.1 Retain audit log history for at least 12 months, with at least the most recent three months immediately available for analysis.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Historical records of activity are available immediately to support incident response and are retained for at least 12 months.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.5.1.a Examine documentation to verify that the following is defined:
- Audit log retention policies.
- Procedures for retaining audit log history for at least 12 months, with at least the most recent three months immediately available online.

10.5.1.b Examine configurations of audit log history, interview personnel and examine audit logs to verify that audit logs history is retained for at least 12 months.

10.5.1.c Interview personnel and observe processes to verify that at least the most recent three monthsâ€™ audit log history is immediately available for analysis.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Retaining historical audit logs for at least 12 months is necessary because compromises often go unnoticed for significant lengths of time. Having centrally stored log history allows investigators to better determine the length of time a potential breach was occurring, and the possible system(s) impacted. By having three months of logs immediately available, an entity can quickly identify and minimize impact of a data breach.

**Good Practice**



**Definitions**



**Examples**

Methods that allow logs to be immediately available include storing logs online, archiving logs, or restoring logs quickly from backups.
