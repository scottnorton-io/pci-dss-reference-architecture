I will provide the topic and background information. You may supplement with additional authoritative PCI DSS v4.0 information. Then you will:

1) write a summary of the documentation, evidence, QSA questions, and a cross-reference to mentioned PCI DSS v4.0 requirements, sub-requirements, and external resources.

2) write a complete persuasive LinkedIn article about the topic to help a client prepare for their annual assessment that includes a list of documentation and evidence the assessing QSA will request.

## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Implement Strong Access Control Measures

### Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data

#### OVERVIEW
Any physical access to cardholder data or systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data provides the opportunity for individuals to access and/or remove systems or hardcopies containing cardholder data; therefore, physical access should be appropriately restricted.

There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9:

1.	Requirements that specifically refer to sensitive areas are intended to apply to those areas only.
2.	Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any sensitive areas residing within the CDE.
3.	Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a data center or office space.

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas” and other PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 9.1

9.1 Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

9.1.1 All security policies and operational procedures that are identified in Requirement 9 are:
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 9 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management’s intent.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.1.1 Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 9 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Requirement 9.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 9. While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 9, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.

**Good Practice**

It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.

**Definitions**

Security policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.

Policies and procedures, including updates, are actively communicated to all affected personnel, and are supported by operating procedures describing how to perform activities.

**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

9.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 9 are documented, assigned, and understood.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the activities in Requirement 9 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

9.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that descriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 9 are documented and assigned.

9.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for performing activities in Requirement 9 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

If roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities may not occur.

**Good Practice**

Roles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.

As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.

A method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).
