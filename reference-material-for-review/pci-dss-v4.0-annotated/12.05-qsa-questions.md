A Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) may ask the following questions during an interview and observation regarding PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 12.5:

1. Who is responsible for maintaining the inventory of system components that fall under the scope of PCI DSS?

2. How often is the inventory updated, and what prompts an update?

3. Can you demonstrate how you identify and describe the function/use of each system component in the inventory?

4. Can you show an example of how newly added system components or changes to existing ones are documented in the inventory?

5. How do you ensure all assets, containers, and images that may be instantiated are included in the inventory?

6. What procedures are in place to ensure the inventory is kept current? Can you walk me through the process?

7. Can you provide evidence of regular reviews of the inventory to ensure its completeness and accuracy?

8. How do you manage and track decommissioned components in the inventory?

9. If you use an inventory management tool, how does it aid in maintaining and updating the inventory?

10. Can you demonstrate how the inventory helps in implementing PCI DSS requirements efficiently?

Remember, the aim of these questions is not just to establish that an inventory exists, but to validate its accuracy, completeness, and the processes in place to maintain it.
