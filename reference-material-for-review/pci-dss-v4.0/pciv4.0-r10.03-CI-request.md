##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 10.2

10.2 Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.2.1 Audit logs are enabled and active for all system components and cardholder data.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Records of all activities affecting system components and cardholder data are captured.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.2.1 Interview the system administrator and examine system configurations to verify that audit logs are enabled and active for all system components.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Audit logs must exist for all system components. Audit logs send alerts the system administrator, provides data to other monitoring mechanisms, such as intrusion-detection systems (IDS) and security information and event monitoring systems (SIEM) tools, and provide a history trail for post-incident investigation.

Logging and analyzing security-relevant events enable an organization to identify and trace potentially malicious activities.

**Good Practice**

When an entity considers which information to record in their logs, it is important to remember that information stored in audit logs is sensitive and should be protected per requirements in this standard. Care should be taken to only store essential information in the audit logs to minimize risk.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.2.1.1 Audit logs capture all individual user access to cardholder data.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Records of all individual user access to cardholder data are captured.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.2.1.1 Examine audit log configurations and log data to verify that all individual user access to cardholder data is logged.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

It is critical to have a process or system that links user access to system components accessed. Malicious individuals could obtain knowledge of a user account with access to systems in the CDE, or they could create a new, unauthorized account to access cardholder data.

**Good Practice**

A record of all individual access to cardholder data can identify which accounts may have been compromised or misused.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

A record of all individual access to cardholder data can identify which accounts may have been compromised or misused.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Records of all actions performed by individuals with elevated privileges are captured.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.2.1.2 Examine audit log configurations and log data to verify that all actions taken by any individual with administrative access, including any interactive use of application or system accounts, are logged.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Accounts with increased access privileges, such as the “administrator” or “root” account, have the potential to significantly impact the security or operational functionality of a system. Without a log of the activities performed, an organization is cannot trace any issues resulting from an administrative mistake or misuse of privilege back to the specific action and account.

**Good Practice**



**Definitions**

Accounts with administrative access are those assigned with specific privileges or abilities for that account to manage systems, networks, and/or applications. The functions or activities considered to be administrative are beyond those performed by regular users as part of routine business functions.

**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.2.1.3 Audit logs capture all access to audit logs.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Records of all access to audit logs are captured.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.2.1.3 Examine audit log configurations and log data to verify that access to all audit logs is captured.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Malicious users often attempt to alter audit logs to hide their actions. A record of access allows an organization to trace any inconsistencies or potential tampering of the logs to an individual account. Having logs identify changes, additions, and deletions to the audit logs can help retrace steps made by unauthorized personnel.

**Good Practice**

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Records of all invalid access attempts are captured.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.2.1.4 Examine audit log configurations and log data to verify that invalid logical access attempts are captured.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Malicious individuals will often perform multiple access attempts on targeted systems. Multiple invalid login attempts may be an indication of an unauthorized user’s attempts to “brute force” or guess a password.

**Good Practice**
