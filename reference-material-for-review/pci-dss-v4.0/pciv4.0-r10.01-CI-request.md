## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

### Requirement 11:	Test Security of Systems and Networks Regularly

#### OVERVIEW
Vulnerabilities are being discovered continually by malicious individuals and researchers, and being introduced by new software. System components, processes, and bespoke and custom software should be tested frequently to ensure security controls continue to reflect a changing environment.

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

---

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 11.1

11.1 Processes and mechanisms for regularly testing security of systems and networks are defined and understood.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

11.1.1 All security policies and operational procedures that are identified in Requirement 11 are:
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 11 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management’s intent.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

11.1.1 Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Requirement 11.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 11. While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 11, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.

**Good Practice**

It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.

**Definitions**

Security policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.

**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

11.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 11 are documented, assigned, and understood.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the activities in Requirement 11 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

11.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that descriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 11 are documented and assigned.

11.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for performing activities in Requirement 11 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

If roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.

**Good Practice**

Roles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.

As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.

**Definitions**



**Examples**

A method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).
