## Appendix A Additonal PCI Requirements

### Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi-Tenant Service Providers

#### OVERVIEW
All service providers are responsible for meeting PCI DSS requirements for their own environments as applicable to the services offered to their customers. In addition, multi-tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix.

Multi-tenant service providers are a type of third-party service provider that offers various shared services to merchants and other service providers, where customers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and/or databases. Services may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e-commerce and/or “shopping cart” services, web- based hosting services, payment applications, various cloud applications and services, and connections to payment gateways and processors.

Service providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co-location or “co-lo” providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available on a rental basis, are not considered multi-tenant service providers for purposes of this Appendix.

Note: Even though a multi-tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirements that are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared between the provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to the relationships between all third-party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific services the customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, and which requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.
