##### GUIDANCE
**Purpose**

Requirement 1.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 1. While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 1, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.

**Good Practice**

It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For these reasons, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.

**Definitions**

Security policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS
1.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 1 are documented, assigned, and understood

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE
Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the activities in Requirement 1 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES


###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES
1.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that descriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 1 are documented and assigned.

1.1.2.b Interview personnel responsible for performing activities in Requirement 1 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.

##### GUIDANCE
**Purpose**

If roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.

**Good Practice**

Roles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.
As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.

**Examples**

A method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).
