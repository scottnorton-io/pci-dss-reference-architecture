As a trusted advisor QSA, I would like to write two persuasive LinkedIn article about a PCI DSS v4.0 topic that include relevant hashtags, a very brief article summary, and a single sentence tl;dr.

The target of the first article is the client being assessed, sumarizing their obligations under this rquirement to maintain compliance.
The target of the second article is a QSA that covers questions they ask during the interview and observation of this requirement.
The third request is just the list of QSAs questions and observations for this requirement.

I will provide you authoritative guidance about the now released v4.0 sub-requirement:

[INSERT REQUIREMENT DETAILS]
## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Maintain an Information Security Policy

### Requirement 12: Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 12.7

12.7 Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

12.7.1 Potential personnel who will have access to the CDE are screened, within the constraints of local laws, prior to hire to minimize the risk of attacks from internal sources.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

The risk related to allowing new members of staff access to the CDE is understood and managed.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

For those potential personnel to be hired for positions such as store cashiers, who only have access to one card number at a time when facilitating a transaction, this requirement is a recommendation only.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

12.7.1 Interview responsible Human Resource department management to verify that screening is conducted, within the constraints of local laws, prior to hiring potential personnel who will have access to the CDE.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Performing thorough screening prior to hiring potential personnel who are expected to be given access to the CDE provides entities with the information necessary to make informed risk decisions regarding personnel they hire that will have access to the CDE.

Other benefits of screening potential personnel include helping to ensure workplace safety and confirming information provided by prospective employees on their resumes.

**Good Practice**

Entities should consider screening for existing personnel anytime they transfer into roles where they have access to the CDE from roles where they did not have this access.

To be effective, the level of screening should be appropriate for the position. For example, positions requiring greater responsibility or that have administrative access to critical data or systems may warrant more detailed or more frequent screening than positions with less responsibility and access.

**Definitions**



**Examples**

Screening options can include, as appropriate for the entity’s region, previous employment history, review of public information/social media resources, criminal record, credit history, and reference checks.
