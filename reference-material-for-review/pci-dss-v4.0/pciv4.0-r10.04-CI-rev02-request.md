## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

### Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data

#### OVERVIEW

Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.

This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).

These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 10.4

10.4 Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.4.1 The following audit logs are reviewed at least once daily:
- All security events.
- Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit CHD and/or SAD.
- Logs of all critical system components.
- Logs of all servers and system components that perform security functions (for example, network security controls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers).

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Potentially suspicious or anomalous activities are quickly identified to minimize impact.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.4.1.a Examine security policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for reviewing all elements specified in this requirement at least once daily.

10.4.1.b Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that all elements specified in this requirement are reviewed at least once daily.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Many breaches occur months before being detected. Regular log reviews mean incidents can be quickly identified and proactively addressed.

**Good Practice**

Checking logs daily (7 days a week, 365 days a year, including holidays) minimizes the amount of time and exposure of a potential breach. Log harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized log management systems, event log analyzers, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions are examples of automated tools that can be used to meet this requirement.

Daily review of security events—for example, notifications or alerts that identify suspicious or anomalous activities—as well as logs from critical system components, and logs from systems that perform security functions, such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems, etc., is necessary to identify potential issues.

The determination of “security event” will vary for each organization and may include consideration for the type of technology, location, and function of the device. Organizations may also wish to maintain a baseline of “normal” traffic to help identify anomalous behavior.
An entity that uses third-party service providers to perform log review services is responsible to provide context about the entity’s environment to the service providers, so it understands the entity’s environment, has a baseline of “normal” traffic for the entity, and can detect potential security issues and provide accurate exceptions and anomaly notifications.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.4.1.1 Automated mechanisms are used to perform audit log reviews.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Potentially suspicious or anomalous activities are identified via a repeatable and consistent mechanism.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.4.1.1 Examine log review mechanisms and interview personnel to verify that automated mechanisms are used to perform log reviews.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Manual log reviews are difficult to perform, even for one or two systems, due to the amount of log data that is generated. However, using log harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized log management systems, event log analyzers, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions can help facilitate the process by identifying log events that need to be reviewed.

**Good Practice**

The entity should keep logging tools aligned with any changes in their environment by periodically reviewing tool settings and updating settings to reflect any changes.

**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.4.2 Logs of all other system components (those not specified in Requirement 10.4.1) are reviewed periodically.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Potentially suspicious or anomalous activities for other system components (not included in 10.4.1) are reviewed in accordance with the entity’s identified risk.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

This requirement is applicable to all other in-scope system components not included in Requirement 10.4.1.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.4.2.a Examine security policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for reviewing logs of all other system components periodically.
10.4.2.b Examine documented results of log reviews and interview personnel to verify that log reviews are performed periodically.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Periodic review of logs for all other system components (not specified in Requirement 10.4.1) helps to identify indications of potential issues or attempts to access critical systems via less-critical systems.

**Good Practice**



**Definitions**



**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.4.2.1 The frequency of periodic log reviews for all other system components (not defined in Requirement 10.4.1) is defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Log reviews for lower-risk system components are performed at a frequency that addresses the entity’s risk.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.4.2.1.a Examine the entity’s targeted risk analysis for the frequency of periodic log reviews for all other system components (not defined in Requirement 10.4.1) to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified at Requirement 12.3.1.

10.4.2.1.b Examine documented results of periodic log reviews of all other system components (not defined in Requirement 10.4.1) and interview personnel to verify log reviews are performed at the frequency specified in the entity’s targeted risk analysis performed for this requirement.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Entities can determine the optimum period to review these logs based on criteria such as the complexity of each entity’s environment, the number of types of systems that are required to be evaluated, and the functions of such systems.

**Good Practice**

**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.4.3 Exceptions and anomalies identified during the review process are addressed.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Suspicious or anomalous activities are addressed.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.4.3.a Examine security policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for addressing exceptions and anomalies identified during the review process.

10.4.3.b Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that, when exceptions and anomalies are identified, they are addressed.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

If exceptions and anomalies identified during the log-review process are not investigated, the entity may be unaware of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities occurring within their network.

**Good Practice**

Entities should consider how to address the following when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies:
- How log review activities are recorded,
- How to rank and prioritize exceptions and anomalies,
- What procedures should be in place to report and escalate exceptions and anomalies, and
- Who is responsible for investigating and for any remediation tasks.
