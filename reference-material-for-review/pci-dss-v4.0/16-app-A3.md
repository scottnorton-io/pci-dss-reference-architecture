# PCI DSS v4.0

## Appendix A Additonal PCI Requirements

### Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV)

#### OVERVIEW
This Appendix applies only to entities designated by a payment brand(s) or acquirer as requiring additional validation of existing PCI DSS requirements. An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a payment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include:

•	Those storing, processing, and/or transmitting large volumes of account data,
•	Those providing aggregation points for account data, or
•	Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data. Additionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix.

These supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on a continuous basis through validation of business-as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping consideration.

Note: Some requirements have defined timeframes (for example, at least once every three months or at least once every six months) within which certain activities are to be performed. For initial assessment to this document, it is not required that an activity has been performed for every such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies:

•	The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent three-month or six-month period), and
•	The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe.

For subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe (for example, an activity required every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does not exceed 90 days).

Not all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSS Requirements are duplicated in this appendix. Any questions about this appendix should be addressed to acquirers or payment brands.
