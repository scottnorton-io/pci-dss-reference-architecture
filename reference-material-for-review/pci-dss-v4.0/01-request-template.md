[INSERT REQUIREMENT DETAILS]
## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Maintain an Information Security Policy

### Requirement 12: Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs

#### OVERVIEW
The organization’s overall information security policy sets the tone for the whole entity and informs personnel what is expected of them. All personnel should be aware of the sensitivity of cardholder data and their responsibilities for protecting it.

For the purposes of Requirement 12, “personnel” refers to full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees, contractors, and consultants with security responsibilities for protecting account data or that can impact the security of account data.

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 12.1

12.1 A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known and current.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

12.1.1 An overall information security policy is:
- Established.
- Published.
- Maintained.
- Disseminated to all relevant personnel, as well as to relevant vendors and business partners.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

The strategic objectives and principles of information security are defined, adopted, and known to all personnel.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

12.1.1 Examine the information security policy and interview personnel to verify that the overall information security policy is managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

An organization’s overall information security policy ties to and governs all other policies and procedures that define protection of cardholder data.

The information security policy communicates management’s intent and objectives regarding the protection of its most valuable assets, including cardholder data.

Without an information security policy, individuals will make their own value decisions on the controls that are required within the organization which may result in the organization neither meeting its legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, nor being able to adequately protect its assets in a consistent manner.

To ensure the policy is implemented, it is important that all relevant personnel within the organization, as well as relevant third parties, vendors, and business partners are aware of the organization’s information security policy and their responsibilities for protecting information assets.

**Good Practice**

The security policy for the organization identifies the purpose, scope, accountability, and information that clearly defines the organization’s position regarding information security.

The overall information security policy differs from individual security policies that address specific technology or security disciplines. This policy sets forth the directives for the entire organization whereas individual security policies align and support the overall security policy and communicate specific objectives for technology or security disciplines.

It is important that all relevant personnel within the organization, as well as relevant third parties, vendors, and business partners are aware of the organization’s information security policy and their responsibilities for protecting information assets.

**Definitions**

“Relevant” for this requirement means that the information security policy is disseminated to those with roles applicable to some or all the topics in the policy, either within the company or because of services/functions performed by a vendor or third party.

**Examples**

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

12.1.4 Examine the information security policy to verify that information security is formally assigned to a Chief Information Security Officer or other information security-knowledgeable member of executive management.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

To ensure someone with sufficient authority and responsibility is actively managing and championing the organization’s information security program, accountability and responsibility for information security needs to be assigned at the executive level within an organization.

Common executive management titles for this role include Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Chief Security Officer (CSO – to meet this requirement, the CSO role must be responsible for information security). These positions are often at the most senior level of management and are part of the chief executive level or C-level, typically reporting to the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors.

**Good Practice**

Entities should also consider transition and/or succession plans for these key personnel to avoid potential gaps in critical security activities.
