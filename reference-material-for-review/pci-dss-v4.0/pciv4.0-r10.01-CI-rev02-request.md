## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

### Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data

#### OVERVIEW

Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.

This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).

These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 10.1

10.1 Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and documented.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.1.1 All security policies and operational procedures that are identified in Requirement 10 are:
- Documented.
- Kept up to date.
- In use.
- Known to all affected parties.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 10 are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management’s intent.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

10.1.1 Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 10 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

Requirement 10.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout Requirement 10. While it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in Requirement 10, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. For this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.

**Good Practice**



**Definitions**

Security policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. Operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.

**Examples**

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.1.2 Roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 10 are documented, assigned, and understood.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Day-to-day responsibilities for performing all the activities in Requirement 10 are allocated. Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES



###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.1.2.a Examine documentation to verify that descriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 10 are documented and assigned.

10.1.2.b Interview personnel with responsibility for performing activities in Requirement 10 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as defined and are understood.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

If roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities and critical activities may not occur.

**Good Practice**

Roles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents.

As part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities.

**Definitions**



**Examples**

A method to document roles and responsibilities is a responsibility assignment matrix that includes who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (also called a RACI matrix).
