EMBEDDED CUSTOM INSTRUCTION:
As a PCI DSS QSA trusted advisor, I would like you to write three PCI DSS v4.0 items based on authoritative information from the March 2022 PCI DSS Requirements and Testing Procedures version 4.0.  I will provide the topic and background information. You may supplement with additional authoritative PCI DSS v4.0 information. Then you will:

1) write a summary of the documentation, evidence, QSA questions, and a cross-reference to mentioned PCI DSS v4.0 requirements, sub-requirements, and external resources.

2) write a complete persuasive LinkedIn article about the topic to help a client prepare for their annual assessment that includes a list of documentation and evidence the assessing QSA will request.

3) write a complete persuasive LinkedIn article about the topic to help an assessing PCI DSS QSA prepare for interview and observations of an assessed client for this requirement.

The output for items 2) and 3) should include a title, sub-title, relevant hashtags, brief SEO article summary to be used as the LinkedIn post presenting the article, and a single sentence tldr;

Please acknowledge my request. After you acknowledge, I will specifically ask for each item to be created.

## PRINCIPLE PCI DSS REQUIREMENT: Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

### Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data

#### OVERVIEW

Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.

This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).

These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).

Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

##### REQUIREMENTS and TESTING PROCEDURES 10.7

10.7 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

**10.7.1 Additional requirement for service providers only**: Failures of critical security control systems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems:
- Network security controls.
- IDS/IPS.
- FIM.
- Anti-malware solutions.
- Physical access controls.
- Logical access controls.
- Audit logging mechanisms.
- Segmentation controls (if used).

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Failures in critical security control systems are promptly identified and addressed.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.

This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 10.7.2 as of 31 March 2025.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

**10.7.1.a Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only**: Examine documentation to verify that processes are defined for the prompt detection and addressing of failures of critical security control systems, including but not limited to failure of all elements specified in this requirement.

**10.7.1.b Additional testing procedure for service provider assessments only**: Observe detection and alerting processes and interview personnel to verify that failures of critical security control systems are detected and reported, and that failure of a critical security control results in the generation of an alert.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample time to compromise system components and steal account data from the CDE.

**Good Practice**

The specific types of failures may vary, depending on the function of the device system component and technology in use. Typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner, such as a firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.7.2 Failures of critical security control systems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems:
- Network security controls.
- IDS/IPS.
- Change-detection mechanisms.
- Anti-malware solutions.
- Physical access controls.
- Logical access controls.
- Audit logging mechanisms.
- Segmentation controls (if used).
- Audit log review mechanisms.
- Automated security testing tools (if used).

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Failures in critical security control systems are promptly identified and addressed.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

This requirement applies to all entities, including service providers, and will supersede Requirement 10.7.1 as of 31 March 2025. It includes two additional critical security control systems not in Requirement 10.7.1.

This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.7.2.a Examine documentation to verify that processes are defined for the prompt detection and addressing of failures of critical security control systems, including but not limited to failure of all elements specified in this requirement.

10.7.2.b Observe detection and alerting processes and interview personnel to verify that failures of critical security control systems are detected and reported, and that failure of a critical security control results in the generation of an alert.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample time to compromise system components and steal account data from the CDE.

**Good Practice**

The specific types of failures may vary, depending on the function of the device system component and technology in use. However, typical failures include a system no longer performing its security function or not functioning in its intended manner—for example, a firewall erasing its rules or going offline.

###### DEFINED APPROACH REQUIREMENTS

10.7.3 Failures of any critical security controls systems are responded to promptly, including but not limited to:
- Restoring security functions.
- Identifying and documenting the duration (date and time from start to end) of the security failure.
- Identifying and documenting the cause(s) of failure and documenting required remediation.
- Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure.
- Determining whether further actions are required as a result of the security failure.
- Implementing controls to prevent the cause of failure from reoccurring.
- Resuming monitoring of security controls.

###### CUSTOMIZED APPROACH OBJECTIVE

Failures of critical security control systems are analyzed, contained, and resolved, and security controls restored to minimize impact. Resulting security issues are addressed, and measures taken to prevent reoccurrence.

###### APPLICABILITY NOTES

This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider until 31 March 2025, after which this requirement will apply to all entities.

*This is a current v3.2.1 requirement that applies to service providers only. However, this requirement is a best practice for all other entities until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.*

###### DEFINED APPROACH TESTING PROCEDURES

10.7.3.a Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that processes are defined and implemented to respond to a failure of any critical security control system and include at least all elements specified in this requirement.

10.7.3.b Examine records to verify that failures of critical security control systems are documented to include:
- Identification of cause(s) of the failure.
- Duration (date and time start and end) of the security failure.
- Details of the remediation required to address the root cause.

##### GUIDANCE

**Purpose**

If alerts from failures of critical security control systems are not responded to quickly and effectively, attackers may use this time to insert malicious software, gain control of a system, or steal data from the entity’s environment.

**Good Practice**

Documented evidence (for example, records within a problem management system) should provide support that processes and procedures are in place to respond to security failures. In addition, personnel should be aware of their responsibilities in the event of a failure. Actions and responses to the failure should be captured in the documented evidence.
