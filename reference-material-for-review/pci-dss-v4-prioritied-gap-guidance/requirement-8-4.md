| 8.4.1.a         | Document Examination & Observation | Network and system configurations detailing the MFA requirements for non-console administrative access into the CDE.            | Can you provide the configuration files that specify the MFA requirements for non-console administrative access? How do you ensure that MFA is enforced for all non-console access into the CDE? |
| 8.4.1.b         | Observation                        | Evidence of administrator personnel logging into the CDE utilizing MFA (log files, screenshots).                                | Can you demonstrate an instance where MFA is required for an administrator logging into the CDE? How are MFA authentications logged and monitored?                                               |
| 8.4.2.a         | Document Examination & Observation | Network and system configurations that indicate the implementation of MFA for all access points into the CDE.                   | Can you provide documentation that demonstrates MFA implementation for all access points into the CDE? How is this configuration maintained and audited?                                         |
| 8.4.2.b         | Observation                        | Evidence showing personnel logging into the CDE using MFA (log files, screenshots).                                             | Can you demonstrate a live instance where MFA is required for personnel logging into the CDE? How is adherence to MFA policies ensured?                                                          |
| 8.4.3.a         | Document Examination & Observation | Network and system configurations for remote access servers, demonstrating MFA implementation as per the specified requirement. | Can you provide the configurations that verify MFA is implemented for remote access servers? How do these configurations align with the elements specified in the requirement?                   |
| 8.4.3.b         | Observation                        | Evidence of personnel connecting remotely and utilizing MFA (logs of remote access connections, video demonstrations).          | Can you demonstrate a scenario where personnel connecting remotely are required to use MFA? How is the usage of MFA monitored for remote connections?                                            |
