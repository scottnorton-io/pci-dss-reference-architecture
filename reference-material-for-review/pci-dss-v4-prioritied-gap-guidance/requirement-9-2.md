| **9.2.1**     | Observation & Personnel Interview | Records of physical security controls in place to restrict access to systems in the CDE.                                                                                   | 1. Can you demonstrate the physical security controls in place that restrict access to systems in the CDE?`<br>` 2. How are these controls monitored and maintained?                                   |
| **9.2.1.1.a** | Location Observation              | Evidence of video cameras and/or physical access control mechanisms monitoring the entry and exit points of sensitive areas within the CDE.                                | 1. Can you show the functioning of video cameras or access control mechanisms at the entry and exit points?`<br>` 2. How do these mechanisms ensure the security of sensitive areas within the CDE?    |
| **9.2.1.1.b** | Location Observation              | Evidence that the video cameras or physical access control mechanisms are protected against tampering or disabling.                                                        | 1. How are the video cameras or access control mechanisms protected from tampering or disabling?`<br>` 2. Can you provide instances where these protections were tested or validated?                  |
| **9.2.1.1.c** | Observation & Personnel Interview | Documentation evidencing the review and correlation of collected data, and proof of data storage for at least three months.                                                | 1. How is data from video cameras or access control mechanisms reviewed and correlated with other entries?`<br>` 2. Can you provide evidence of data storage for at least three months?                |
| **9.2.2**     | Observation & Personnel Interview | Records showing the controls in place to restrict access to publicly accessible network jacks within the facility.                                                         | 1. Can you demonstrate the physical and/or logical controls restricting access to publicly accessible network jacks within the facility?`<br>` 2. How are these controls monitored?                    |
| **9.2.3**     | Observation & Personnel Interview | Documentation showing restricted physical access to wireless access points, gateways, networking/communications hardware, and telecommunication lines within the facility. | 1. Can you show the controls in place that restrict physical access to wireless access points and other related hardware within the facility?`<br>` 2. How is restricted access ensured and monitored? |
| **9.2.4**     | Observation                       | Evidence of consoles in sensitive areas being "locked" to prevent unauthorized use.                                                                                        | 1. Can you demonstrate a system administrator's attempt to log into "locked" consoles in sensitive areas?`<br>` 2. How are these "locks" maintained and updated to prevent unauthorized access?        |
