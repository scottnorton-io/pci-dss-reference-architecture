Here are updated versions of the stories:

**Company Overview: Condueit - Weak and Leak**
Condueit: Weak and Leak (CW&L), a one-stop-shop for customer needs, thrived on the mantra, "You need it, we do it." The organization became a cauldron of relentless innovation and pushed out new products with rapid speed. The creative chaos was palpable as employees worked tirelessly to keep up with the ever-changing needs of the market. However, amidst this whirlwind of innovation, one critical aspect was consistently overlooked - data security. CW&L existed in a world where data security was someone else's concern. It wasn't until they faced the potential ramifications of a data breach that they realized the importance of securing their customer's data.

**Starting Point - Open Card Data in a Flat Network**
With a flat network and minimal security measures, cardholder data flowed freely through CW&L's systems. Data security was an afterthought, and the company's sole focus was on shipping products, leading to a large amount of unencrypted, sensitive data stored on their servers.

**Initial Stage - Lack of Formalized Vulnerability Management**
Due to the absence of a proper vulnerability management program, CW&L was continually reacting to threats rather than proactively preventing them. This reactive approach to vulnerabilities exposed the company to unnecessary risk and potential data breaches.

**Initial Stage - Reactive and Inefficient Logging**
CW&L's logging was sporadic and inefficient, with no established process for monitoring and analyzing logs. This lack of attention to log monitoring meant critical events often went unnoticed, further exposing the company to potential breaches.

**Initial Stage - Limited Access Control**
Without a robust access control system, CW&L employees had widespread access to sensitive data, regardless of their job role or requirements. This broad access further exacerbated the risk of a potential data breach.

**Initial Stage - Absence of Formal Security Policies**
With no formal security policies in place, CW&L employees were unaware of their roles and responsibilities concerning data security. This lack of security awareness led to further vulnerabilities and potential breaches.

**The Trigger - PCI DSS Compliance Failure**
A wake-up call came in the form of a failed PCI DSS audit. Realizing the potential damage a data breach could cause, CW&L began the journey of overhauling their security practices and policies, triggering a transformation that would redefine the company's culture and approach to data security.

**Transition and Infrastructure Overhaul (2018-2019)**
Recognizing the need for a robust security framework, CW&L started its journey by revamping their infrastructure, moving from a flat network to a segmented one, and implementing stringent security controls. This period saw the introduction of a Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), an administrative network that supports the CDE, a corporate network, and a guest wireless network. 

**Implementing the Prioritized Approach (2019-2020)**
CW&L embarked on the journey of PCI DSS compliance, utilizing the Prioritized Approach. The organization focused on data segmentation, implementing strong access control measures, and establishing regular monitoring and testing of security systems, taking one step at a time towards their goal.

**Developing Core GRC Processes (2019-2020)**
While infrastructure changes were in progress, CW&L also started developing its Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) program. This included a formalized vulnerability management program, efficient logging, and proactive monitoring. 

**The DESV Challenge (2020-2021)**
CW&L took on the challenge of the Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV), an arduous process that tested the organization's

 commitment to data security. Despite the complexities, CW&L persevered and emerged victorious, strengthening their reputation as a company committed to data security.

**Achieving Compliance and Beyond (2021-2023)**
Finally, CW&L achieved full PCI DSS v4.0 compliance. This milestone marked the completion of their journey from a company that didn't prioritize data security to one that had made it a core pillar of their operations. CW&L's transformation had not only enhanced their data security practices but also built a company culture centered around the importance of securing customer data.

These updated stories ensure consistency with the summary, highlighting the transformation of CW&L's approach to data security and making the narrative more cohesive and engaging.
