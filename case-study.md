## Backstory, Illusory Plan, and Company Culture

* The organization tries to be all things to all people - you need it, we do it
* The organization puts products first - ship it
* The organization uses treats people dispensable resources - if you can't do it, someone else can
* Information and Data Security is not even an afterthought - your data is our data

## Future story and company culture

* Your boss excitedly tells your team she's taking her son to football practice early on Wednesday afternoons
* You hear laughter, often
* Innovation and failures are welcomed, not feared
* The company handbook is written in simple, plain language
* Your colleagues come from different backgrounds and nationalities
* Meetings start on time, are kept to 25 or 50 minutes, and end on time
* Your kids are welcome to drop-in at any time
* You're rarely the smartest person in a meeting
* Gossip is shut down quickly
* You're trusted to work remote

Company culture is not a sentence you write in your employee handbook. It's how your team behaves when no-one's looking.

Your strategy might be perfect, but without the right culture, you're dead.
